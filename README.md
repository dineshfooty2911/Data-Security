# Sports Turf Management and Booking Web Application

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a web-based application that facilitates the management and booking of sports turfs. The project aims to provide an intuitive platform for users to register, log in, view available turfs, book time slots, and manage their bookings. The project emphasizes not only functional aspects but also robust security measures to ensure the integrity of user data and system functionality.

## Goals
- Develop a user-friendly web application for turf management and booking.
- Implement secure user authentication and password policies to safeguard user accounts.
- Create a secure environment that prevents unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Incorporate an audit trail mechanism to track critical user actions and system events.
- Demonstrate the importance of adhering to secure coding practices.
- Provide a practical example of identifying security vulnerabilities and rectifying them.
- Educate users about the significance of strong passwords and data protection.

## Objectives

### Step 1: Creating the Web Application
- The primary purpose of this section is to create a website and demonstrate if the website is vulnerable to any attacks from the hackers, such as:
  1. **SQL Injection**: Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate the database, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, or perform destructive actions.
  2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Attackers trick authenticated users into unknowingly sending unauthorized requests to a website, exploiting the trust between the user and the site.

### Step 2: Data Breaching
- After the website development, this site is tested to see for any vulnerabilities that would allow the hackers to get into the website illegally and access sensitive information. This step is crucial in software development testing, as this determines the stability of the site.
- The site is checked with illegal username, password access, and HTTP link injection to see if any details regarding the database show up as an error to the user.

### Step 3: Data Security
- The main goal of this step is to find and implement measures to nullify the vulnerabilities found in the previous step. The content below will explain all the measures taken for website security.
