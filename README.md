## Introduction
This project aims to develop a web-based application that facilitates the management and booking of sports turfs...

## Goals
- Develop a user-friendly web application for turf management and booking.
- Implement secure user authentication and password policies to safeguard user accounts.
- Create a secure environment that prevents unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Incorporate an audit trail mechanism to track critical user actions and system events.
- Demonstrate the importance of adhering to secure coding practices.
- Provide a practical example of identifying security vulnerabilities and rectifying them.
- Educate users about the significance of strong passwords and data protection.

## Objectives

### Step 1: Creating the Web Application
- The primary purpose of this section is to create a website and demonstrate if the website is vulnerable to any attacks from the hackers, such as,
    1. SQL Injection: Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate the database, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, or perform destructive actions.
    2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Attackers trick authenticated users into unknowingly sending unauthorized requests to a website, exploiting the trust between the user and the site.

### Step 2: Data Breaching
- After the website development, this site is tested to see for any vulnerabilities that would allow the hackers to get into the website illegally and access sensitive information.
- The site is checked with illegal username, password access, and HTTP link injection to see if any details regarding the database show up as an error to the user.

### Step 3: Data Security
- The main goal of this step is to find and implement measures to nullify the vulnerabilities found in the previous step.

## Techniques & Technologies Used
- Visual Studio Code (HTML & CSS)
- Bootstrap
- MYSQL
- JavaScript
